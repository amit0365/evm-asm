  EvmAsm.Evm64.ShrCompose

  Hierarchical composition of SHR CPS specs into a single full-program theorem.
  Composes the 5 execution paths through `evm_shr` (90 instructions, 360 bytes):
  - Zero path (shift ≥ 256): Phase A taken → zero_path
  - Body L (L=0..3, shift < 256): Phase A ntaken → B → C(exit L) → body_L → exit
